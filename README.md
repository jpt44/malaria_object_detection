# Malaria Multi-Label Classification and Object Detection

Goal: identify types of malaira-infected cells that exist in an image

Strategies:
1. (Classification Only) Feed each image through a CNN and let it identify the type of infected cell(s) the image contains without finding its location in the image, i.e. no bounding boxes. 
2. (Object Detection Problem) Feed each image through a CNN and let it identify the type of infected cell(s) the image contains and find itâ€™s location, i.e. find bounding boxes
